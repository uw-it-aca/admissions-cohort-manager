        # TLDR: Chrome (and soon Firefox and Safari) require that you set
        # SameSite=None
        # in order to have a cookie set cross-domain. The old behavior of
        # SameSite
        # being 'None' by default is no more. The new default is 'Lax'.
        # The issue is that we can't just set SameSite=None and be done with it,
        # because some older browsers will break with this. Therefore we devise
        # a two-cookie approach: one that does the new behavior of setting
        # SameSite=None, and the second is the "legacy" cookie which relies on
        # the old-default's behavior. If we receive only the legacy cookie in
        # a request, we know we're dealing with one of those older browsers,
        # and we can repair the lost cookie before proceeding to process the
        # request.
        cookie = settings.SESSION_COOKIE_NAME
        legacy = "{}_legacy".format(cookie)

        if cookie in response.cookies:
